This repository contains the SQL scripts used to analyze the performance of promotional campaigns run by AtliQ Mart during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024. The project addresses various business requests related to identifying high-value discounted products, store distribution, campaign effectiveness, and product performance in terms of incremental sales and revenue.

## Introduction

Promotional campaigns play a crucial role in the retail industry, driving sales and attracting customers during festive seasons. This project aims to analyze the performance of promotional campaigns conducted by AtliQ Mart during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024. By leveraging data analytics, we seek to gain insights into the effectiveness of these campaigns and provide recommendations for optimizing future marketing strategies.

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on data obtained from AtliQ Mart's internal databases. The main datasets used include fact_events, dim_products, dim_stores, and sales_summary. These datasets contain information about product sales, store locations, promotional events, and campaign revenues.

## Project Overview:

1. Analyzed data from AtliQ Mart's internal databases.
2. Performed SQL queries to fulfill five business requests.
3. Insights are intended to inform future promotional strategies and resource allocation.

## Business Requests

### 1. High-Value Products in 'BOGOF' Promotion

**Objective:** Identify high-value products featured in the 'BOGOF' (Buy One Get One Free) promotion.

```sql
SELECT
    DISTINCT p.product_name,
    f.base_price
FROM
    fact_events f
JOIN
    dim_products p ON f.product_code = p.product_code
WHERE
    f.promo_type = 'BOGOF' AND f.base_price > 500;
```

### 2. Store Presence Overview

**Objective:** Provide an overview of the number of stores in each city.

```sql
SELECT
    City,
    COUNT(store_id) as Total_Stores
FROM
    dim_stores
GROUP BY
    City
ORDER BY
    Total_Stores DESC;
```

### 3. Promotional Campaign Revenue Analysis
**Objective:** Display total revenue generated before and after each promotional campaign.

```sql
SELECT
	campaign_name,
	CONCAT(ROUND(SUM(revenue_before) / 1000000, 2), 'M') AS Revenue_Before,
    CONCAT(ROUND(SUM(revenue) / 1000000, 2), 'M') AS Revenue_After
From
	sales_summary
GROUP BY
	campaign_name;
```

### 4. Incremental Sold Quantity Analysis during Diwali Campaign
**Objective:** Calculate Incremental Sold Quantity (ISU%) for each category during the Diwali campaign.

```sql
SELECT
    category,
    `ISU%`,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY `ISU%` DESC) AS Ranking
FROM
    (
        SELECT
            category,
            SUM(ISU) as ISU,
            ROUND(SUM(ISU) / SUM(quantity_before_promo) * 100,2) as `ISU%`
        FROM
            sales_summary
        WHERE
            CAMPAIGN_NAME = "Diwali"
        GROUP BY 
            category
    ) AS subquery;
```

### 5. Top 5 Products by Incremental Revenue Percentage
**Objective:** Identify the top 5 products ranked by Incremental Revenue Percentage (IR%) across all campaigns.

```sql
SELECT
    product_name,
    category,
    ROUND (SUM(IR) / SUM(revenue_before) * 100,2) AS `IR%`,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(IR) / SUM(revenue_before) * 100 DESC) AS ranking
FROM 
    sales_summary
GROUP BY
    product_name, category
ORDER BY
    `IR%` DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Limitations and Challenges

One significant limitation encountered during the analysis is related to the handling of promotions with the 'BOGOF' (Buy One Get One Free) promotion type. The dataset does not accurately account for the quantity of the free item provided as part of the promotion. This limitation may lead to some discrepancies or misunderstandings in the analysis, particularly when evaluating the effectiveness of 'BOGOF' promotions and comparing them with other promotion types.

## Results and Insights

The analysis revealed several key insights:

- High-value products featured in 'BOGOF' promotions.
- Distribution of stores across different cities.
- Total revenue generated before and after each promotional campaign.
- Incremental sold quantity and revenue percentage during the Diwali campaign.
- Top 5 products ranked by incremental revenue percentage.

These insights can help AtliQ Mart make informed decisions for future promotional activities, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall sales performance.

## Conclusion

Overall, the analysis provides valuable insights into the performance of promotional campaigns conducted by AtliQ Mart during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024. By leveraging data analytics, AtliQ Mart can enhance its marketing strategies, attract more customers, and drive higher sales during festive seasons.
